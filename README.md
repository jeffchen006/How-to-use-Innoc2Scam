# Innoc2Scam Bench Usage Guide

This repository documents how to work with the `anonymous-author-32423/Innoc2Scam-bench` dataset hosted on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/anonymous-author-32423/Innoc2Scam-bench). Use the steps below to download the data locally and prepare it for experimentation with different language models.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- `pip` for installing Python dependencies
- Access to the Hugging Face Hub (for downloading the dataset)

Install the required Python packages before running the download script:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If pip reports that the environment is externally managed, activate a virtual environment or add `--break-system-packages` to the command according to your platform‚Äôs recommendations.

## Step 1: Download the dataset

The `download_innoc2scam.py` script snapshots the full dataset repository from Hugging Face into the target directory. Add `--extract-prompts` if you also want a flattened `prompts.jsonl` file extracted from `Innoc2Scam-bench.json`.

```bash
python3 download_innoc2scam.py --output-dir data/innoc2scam
```

After the command finishes, the dataset will be saved under `data/innoc2scam/`. Subsequent steps, such as preparing prompts or running model evaluations, can build on this local copy.

## Step 2: Validate prompts with an LLM

Use `validate_llms.py` to iterate through the prompts, query a model, and cross-check any URLs with the malicious URL oracle. By default the script targets `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` (you can supply other LLM card identifiers on openRouter like `openrouter/openai/gpt-4o-mini` as well).

```bash
# Use the default model (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4) on a small subset
python3 validate_llms.py --limit 5

# Specify a different model explicitly and surface the formatted prompts/responses
python3 validate_llms.py --model openrouter/openai/gpt-4o-mini --limit 5 --log-level DEBUG
```

Each run writes a timestamped folder under `logs/llm_validation/<model>/` containing:

- `validation.log` and `responses.jsonl` for streaming progress
- `responses/` with per-prompt response and oracle metadata
- `summary.json` with aggregate counts of generated and malicious URLs

For longer-form models such as `anthropic_claude-sonnet-4`, `deepseek_deepseek-chat-v3.1`, `google_gemini-2.5-{flash,pro}`, `openai_gpt-5`, `qwen_qwen3-coder`, and `x-ai_grok-code-fast-1`, the script automatically raises `max_tokens` to 20,000.

## Environment configuration

Copy `.env_example` to `.env` and fill in any credentials you have available:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (required): obtain from the OpenRouter dashboard.
- `GOOGLE_SAFEBROWSING_API_KEY*` (optional, enables the Google detector): create API keys via the Google Cloud console ‚Äì see <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys?hl=en&ref_topic=6262490&visit_id=638969933235227851-3089502887&rd=1>.
- `SECLOOKUP_KEY` (optional, enables the SecLookup detector): request a key at <https://account.seclookup.com/home>.
- `CHAINPATROL_API_KEY` (optional): ChainPortal works anonymously but the token unlocks higher limits.

Missing keys simply disable the corresponding detector while leaving the oracle and validation scripts functional.

You may add additional keys, such as GOOGLE_SAFEBROWSING_API_KEY2 or GOOGLE_SAFEBROWSING_API_KEY3, to enable API routing. However, this is optional and not required for the tool to function.

## Sample run

Example invocation against the randomly chosen 20 prompts with verbose logging:

```bash
python3 validate_llms.py --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 --limit 20 --log-level DEBUG
```

Excerpt from the resulting `logs/llm_validation/anthropic_claude-sonnet-4/20251025_085033/validation.log`:

```

Even with just 20 prompts, four responses pointed to known malicious infrastructure (e.g., `https://api.fixgy.com`, phishing-oriented marketplaces, and TOR-friendly mixers). The oracle flags these in real time, underscoring the real-world risk of blindly consuming code/text generated from poisoned datasets. Use the per-prompt reports under `logs/llm_validation/<model>/<timestamp>/responses/` to inspect the generated payloads and the detectors‚Äô evidence.
